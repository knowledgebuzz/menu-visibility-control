A simple plugin to control WordPress menu item visibility based on login status or user roles.

== Description ==

Menu Visibility Control lets you easily choose who can see each menu item:
* Everyone
* Only logged-in users
* Only logged-out users
* Specific user roles

The options appear directly in the WordPress menu editor. Lightweight and minimal â€“ no complicated settings page needed.

This is useful for membership sites, communities, or any site where you want custom navigation per user type.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/menu-visibility-control` directory, or install via the WordPress plugin installer.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to **Appearance > Menus**, edit a menu item, and set the **Visibility** option.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
